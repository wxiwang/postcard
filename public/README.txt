The "images" directory contains the images uploaded by the app.

Glitch has limited image storage, and when you run out the app ceases to work. 
In Assignment 3 we will fix this by uploading images to Flickr instead. 

The directory listing on the right is not automatically up-to-date. 
You can see the contents of the image directory by opening the terminal (Tools->Terminal),
navigating to the index directory, and doing "ls".

To get the directory listing to update and be correct, type "refresh" in the terminal. 

You can delete all image files from the command line in the terminal in the
usual way.
